        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>Lookman Adekunle Salami, known professionally as L.A. Salami,is a singer and songwriter from London, England. He's known for crafting magnetic blues-rock songs with a postmodern twist. He has released three EPs and two albums.
           His love for music began when he first heard Bob Dylan on the radio, subsequently leading him to explore more blues and folk music and inspiring him to write his own songs;
           unfortunately, he couldn't afford his own instrument and wasn't introduced to one until he was given a guitar for his 21st birthday.
           After three months of soul-searching, tapping into different creative avenues, and sleeping rough, Salami eventually had his first few songs written and set out to land some gigs.
           Success soon came knocking after relentless gigging, starting with a tour support slot for Lianne La Havas in 2012.
